Ethernet H/W Development Platforms
==================================

For initial development of ethernet applications the following XMOS
development platforms can be used:

  * `XC-2 Ethernet Kit <http://www.xmos.com/products/development-kits/xc-2-ethernet-kit>`_
  * `XDK XS1-G Development Kit <http://www.xmos.com/products/development-kits/xs1-g-development-kit>`_
  * `XP-DSC-BLDC Motor Control Platform <http://www.xmos.com/development-kits/motor-control-platform>`_
  * `XK-AVB-LC-SYS AVB Audio Endpoint <http://www.xmos.com/products/reference-designs/avbl2>`_
  * `XC-3 Dual-port Ethernet Kit <http://www.xmos.com/products/development-kits/xc-3-led-tile-kit>`_

For developing an application specific board with ethernet please
refer to the hardware guides for the above boards with example
schematics, BOMs, design guidelines etc.
