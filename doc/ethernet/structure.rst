Source code structure
---------------------

Source code can be found across several modules:

  * ``module_ethernet`` contains the main MAC code
  * ``module_ethernet_smi`` contains the code for controlling an
    ethernet phy via the SMI configuration protocol
  * ``module_ethernet_board_support`` contains header files for common
    XMOS development boards allowing easy initialization of port
    structures.

Which modules are compiled into the
application is controlled by the ``USED_MODULES`` define in your
application Makefile.


Key Files

The following header files contain prototypes of all functions
required to use the ethernet component. The API is described in 
:ref:`sec_api`.
